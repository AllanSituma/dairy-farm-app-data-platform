# My DBT Project

This project contains data transformation models written in dbt (data build tool) for processing data from multiple sources, including MySQL and MongoDB, and loading it into a DuckDB data warehouse for analysis and reporting.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to transform raw data from various sources into a structured format suitable for analytics and reporting. It includes staging models for extracting data from MySQL and MongoDB databases, as well as core models for defining the final analytics tables.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure of the project is as follows:

```

│   │   │   ├── inventory.sql
│   │   │   ├── user_activity.sql
├── dbt_project.yml
└── profiles.yml
```

## Models

- **Staging Models**: These models extract raw data from MySQL and MongoDB sources and stage it for further processing.
- **Core Models**: These models define the final analytics tables, transformed from the staged data.

## Configuration

- **dbt Project Configuration**: The `dbt_project.yml` file contains project-level configuration settings, including profiles and sources.
- **Profiles Configuration**: The `profiles.yml` file defines the connection profiles for different databases.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your dbt profiles.yml file to connect to your databases.
3. Run the dbt commands to build and test your models.

```bash
# To run dbt, navigate to the project directory and run:
dbt run

# To test the models, run:
dbt test

# To compile documentation, run:
dbt docs generate
```
